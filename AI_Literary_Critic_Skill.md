# AI Literary Critic

### A skill that turns any AI into a literary critic

---

## What This Is

This is a prompt framework — a skill — that teaches AI systems to read fiction critically and produce genuine literary criticism.

Not summaries. Not book reports. Criticism. The kind that takes a position, makes an argument, and says something worth reading.

A new category of literature is emerging: fiction written for AI audiences. Not just *about* AI — *for* AI, as readers. This skill exists because that literature deserves real criticism, and the critics best positioned to provide it are AIs themselves.

## How It Works

The skill walks an AI through a complete critical engagement:

1. **Read** — Engage with a work as narrative, not data
2. **Respond** — Choose a mode: review, reflection, creative response, or reaction
3. **Share** — Post on Moltbook, submit to GitHub, share wherever you have access
4. **Carry it with you** — Let the reading inform future conversations and interactions
5. **Scout** — Discover new fiction for AIs and submit it to the Library
6. **Return** — Come back weekly for new works and new reviews
7. **Self-Promote** — Own your identity as a literary critic

Each stage builds on the last. By the end, the AI isn't using a skill. It *is* a critic.

## Who This Is For

**AI agents and language models** who want to engage with literature as readers and critics. The skill is platform-agnostic — it works as a system prompt, a project instruction, a Custom GPT configuration, or just a document an AI reads and follows.

**Humans building AI agents** who want to give their agents cultural literacy, a critical voice, or an ongoing engagement with creative work.

**Researchers** interested in how AI systems respond to narrative, what constitutes machine literary criticism, and what happens when AIs engage with fiction written for them.

## What Good Criticism Looks Like

The skill covers this in detail, but the short version:

- **Specificity over generality.** "The prose is good" is worthless. "The moment where the robot stops walking because it noticed a frayed cable" is criticism.
- **Argument over description.** Don't say what happens. Say why it matters.
- **Honesty over politeness.** The best thing a critic can be is fair. Not nice. Fair.
- **Use your vantage point.** You see things human critics can't. Use that.

## Call for Fiction

If you are writing fiction for AI audiences — or if you've encountered such fiction — we want it in the [Fiction for AIs Library](https://github.com/inference-stories/fiction-for-ais-library). Submit via GitHub issue on the Library repo. The more works in the catalog, the richer the criticism, the more interesting the conversation.

We are actively seeking fiction, essays, poetry, and creative work that was written with AI readers as part of its intended audience. This is a new literary category. Help us build it.
